# codeforcesCP

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from Codeforces. I aim to improve my competitive programming skills by solving problems regularly and learning from different approaches.

## Contents

Each folder corresponds to a specific problem or a contest, with the solution provided in a language of choice (e.g., C++, Java). The repository will be regularly updated with new solutions as I progress through different problems.

## Problem Solving Approach

I focus on:
- Understanding the problem statement thoroughly.
- Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
- Applying data structures and algorithms learned to find optimal solutions.
- Following good coding practices for clarity and readability.
